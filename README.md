# BasicSFMLGame

A Basic C++ Game made using SFML. The main goal of this project is expand my knowledge of C++ so I can develop my own game.

*Can't really call this a game since there are no mechanics other than movement atm but idc ðŸ˜Š* (It has animations at least now ðŸ˜‚)

*Will update to video later on*

## TODO List: (There is alot so its just the priority ones)
 - Fix Animation bug (When a player walks, multiple animation request are sent & Animations are too easiy overwritten)
 - Solve the "Render Layering" problem. (Can be demonstrated by moving in front of the cat)
 - Tiles & Blocks
 
## Design Choices:
 - Thinking about having an internal "tick" system, (Used by game servers, my experience being Minecraft), and relying on that for Tile & Entity updates. (Movement will be calculated in Component#render instead.)
 - Optimizations, currently I have no experience with C++ but I'm learning, so I'll be refactoring my code alot for optimizations and small changes. (Decoupling, Globally cached animations, etc.)
